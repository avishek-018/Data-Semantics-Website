I had the opportunity to attend the [Knowledge Graph Conference 2023](https://www.knowledgegraph.tech/), 
which was held at Cornell Tech in New York City from May 8-12. The 
conference was a five-day event, with the first two days dedicated to 
immersive workshops, tutorials, and master classes. These sessions delved 
into cutting-edge advancements within generative AI, large language models, 
natural language processing, and reasoning. The hands-on approach of these 
sessions provided attendees with valuable opportunities to deepen their 
understanding of these complex topics. There were also slots for panel 
discussions and startup pitches where in you could propose your idea and 
then the best idea was declared as the winner.

### Keynote Sessions and Presentations

The last three days of the conference were the main event and included keynote 
sessions, presentations, and networking opportunities. The keynote speakers 
were all experts in their fields, and their talks were very informative. In 
particular, the keynote sessions were about integrating knowledge graphs and 
artificial intelligence, focusing on making informed explanatory decisions and 
using the power of knowledge graphs to enhance AI. Sessions showed the great 
potential of bringing the two fields together and sparked conversations about 
future possibilities. Some of the presentations that I found particularly 
interesting were on Enhancing LLMs through Knowledge Graphs, Knowledge Graph 
Completion using Embeddings, Learning Concept Embedding with Neural Reasoner, 
and Spot Signalling among others.

### My Experience as a Speaker

I also had the opportunity to present my own research project on - Explainable AI 
using Background Knowledge. The engaging Q&A sessions following my presentation 
demonstrated the genuine interest and curiosity of attendees in the topic. 
Interacting with fellow researchers, industry professionals, and inquisitive 
participants was inspiring, leading to valuable exchanges and potential avenues 
for collaboration, and I was glad to be able to share my work with the audience.

### Industry Presence and Conclusion

While the conference attracted a notable presence of knowledge graph experts, 
the representation from the AI industry was comparatively modest. Nevertheless, 
the event acted as a catalyst for bridging the gap between academia and industry,
encouraging dialogues and setting the stage for potential collaborations.

Overall, I had a great experience at the Knowledge Graph Conference 2023. I learned 
a lot, met a lot of interesting people, and made some great connections. I would 
definitely recommend this conference to anyone who is interested in learning more about 
knowledge graphs and AI.

**Here are some of the key takeaways from the conference:**

- Knowledge graphs are becoming increasingly important for a variety of applications, including search, 
recommendation systems, and fraud detection. Large language models are a powerful tool for generating 
text, translating languages, and answering questions.

- Reasoning is essential for making sense of the world and for making decisions.

- There is a growing demand for explainable AI, which can help people to understand how AI systems make decisions.

**I would like to thank the Knowledge Graph Conference 2023 organizers for putting on such a great event and having me. 
I look forward to attending the next conference!**
