<h1>Abhilekha Dalal</h1>
<h2>Bio:</h2>
<p>Greetings, I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at DaSeLab, working on my dissertation research that revolves around Explainable AI. My project focuses on explaining the activation patterns of hidden neurons in neural networks in a human-interpretable manner by using knowledge graphs as background knowledge for images. I recently presented my work at KGC 2023 hosted by Cornell Tech in New York City and showcased my research through a poster presentation at US2TS 2022 hosted by Michigan State University.</p>
<p>I completed the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera and am also working on data management for the KnowWhereGraph project. Before starting my Ph.D., I earned an MS degree in Computer Science from Kansas State University in 2021 where I worked on Modular Ontology Modeling for Food Supply Chains, developing an extension to CoModIDE (a plugin for the Protégé ontology modeling platform). Prior to my master’s degree, I worked at Nucleus Software for 1.5 years as a software developer on banking loan software.</p>
