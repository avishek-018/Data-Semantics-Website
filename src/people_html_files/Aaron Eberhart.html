<h1>Aaron Eberhart</h1>
<h2>HomePage:</h2>
<p>Personal Website: https://aaroneberhart.github.io/me/</p>
<h2>Bio:</h2>
<p>Aaron is a PhD student in Computer Science.</p>
<p>He previously completed a BS in Computer Science at Wright State and BA in Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Aaron is primarily interested in computation and logic, with a focus on description logics. In his spare time, he also considers methods for augmenting logical reasoning with machine learning strategies and neural networks. Currently Aaron is involved in a project with the AFOSR that attempts to fit a symbolic cognitive agent with an ontology to help identify gaps in its knowledge.</p>
<p>Aaron is currently working on a functional programming style API for OWL, and preliminary results were accepted as a poster at ISWC 2020. He also previously wrote a paper that was accepted to AAAI-MAKE '20 attempting to apply a new approach to reasoning with deep learning. He worked on a poster for ESWC '18 about random ALC syntax generation during the time between his undergrad and masters. He worked as a grader for CS2210 - Logic for Computer Scientists, and in Spring '17 he worked on an independent study in which he used description logic to model relations in the FrameNet database.</p>
