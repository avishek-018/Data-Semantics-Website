<h2>Bio:</h2>
<p>Greetings, I'm a Master’s student in Computer Science at Kansas State University. In my current role as a Graduate Research Assistant at the Data Semantics Lab, I'm actively involved in a project that explores the field of Explainable AI. My research focuses on developing an automation pipeline that simplifies the process of explaining the activation patterns of hidden neurons in neural networks. Utilizing knowledge graphs as background knowledge for interpreting images, this project aims to render complex AI decisions in a manner that's understandable to humans. I am in the process of designing a system that integrates data preparation, model training, and neural network analysis into a cohesive workflow, thereby facilitating efficiency through single-click execution.</p>
<p>Prior to embarking on my Master’s journey, I gained 5.6 years of industry experience through roles ranging from Senior System Engineer at Infosys Ltd to Software Development Engineer in Test-2 at Akamai Technologies. During this period, I contributed to a variety of projects, including Payments Hub, Investment Banking, Asset Management, and Invoicing Systems, focusing on software development, data analysis, quality assurance, and project management. This experience has provided me with a solid foundation in Python, Java, database systems (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL), and data warehousing technologies, enhancing my capabilities in financial and data analysis projects.</p>
<p>Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I have a keen interest in arts and crafts, and I enjoy exploring new cultures through travel. Cooking and baking are among my favorite pastimes, providing me with a creative outlet and relaxation. My leisure activities also include painting and sketching, which allow me to explore my creative side.</p>
