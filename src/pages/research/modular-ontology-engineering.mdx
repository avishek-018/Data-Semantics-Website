# Modular Ontology Engineering

Modular Ontology Engineering is an opinionated approach to ontology engineering,
by which it is informed by pattern-based methods. In many cases, ontologies are 
designed to be schemas for knowledge graphs; there is a [separate page](/research/knowledge-graphs) 
documenting our contributions to knowledge graphs foundations and applications.

## **Tools**
### [**CoModIDE: The Comprehensive Modular Ontology IDE**](http://comodide.com/)
CoModIDE is an ontology engineering and tooling infrastructure, made in collaboration with Karl Hammar.
- [Paper](/files/pdf/paper538.pdf)
- Graphical Ontology Modeling Evaluated ([Paper](/files/pdf/paper538.pdf) and [Presentation](http://videolectures.net/eswc2020_shimizu_paper_111/))
- [The Upper Ontology Alignment Tool - a Plug-In for CoModIDE](/files/pdf/2021-04-OntoCommons.pdf)

### [**InK Browser: The Interactive Knowledge Browser**](https://github.com/Joseph-Zalewski/inkbrowser)
InkBrowser is a knowledge graph browser with a visual component, built with [Flask](flask.palletsprojects.com) and [mxGraph](jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/).

**Installation Guide:**
1. Fork the Git repository.  
2. Install [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) in a Python virtual environment, with the `venv` folder in the same directory where you put the contents of the Git repo (see Flask installation instructions).  
3. Set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable to `sdbrowser`.  
4. Navigate to the parent of the directory `sdbrowser`.  
5. Activate virtual environment  
   - **Windows:** `./venv/Scripts/activate`  
   - **Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`  
6. Execute `flask run`.  
7. Open a web browser and navigate to `127.0.0.1:5000/client`.

## **Additional Resources**

### [**OWL2DL Rendering**](https://github.com/cogan-shimizu-wsu/OWL2dl-m)
The tool when called with no arguments will launch the GUI. The GUI allows for any number of files from the same directory to be converted simultaneously. 
Use the `browse` buttons to find input and output directories. If the tool is called from the command line with arguments, it will not launch the GUI.

Usage is: `java GUI_Converter.jar input.owl output`

There is a known bug that some times delays the output of `Job finished`. 
However, if the `post-processing` line has been printed, the file is safe to move and open.

### [**SDOnt**](https://github.com/cogan-shimizu-wsu/SDont)
SDOnt is used for generating schema diagrams. It is a prototype implementation of DaSe Lab's method for manually creating schema diagrams. 

Due to file hosting restrictions, the evaluation code has been moved to the [evaluation folder](https://github.com/cogan-shimizu-wsu/SDont/tree/master/evaluation) 
in the GitHub repository.

The `.jar` file located in the top level folder, is executable. It will open a GUI that allows a file to be loaded into it. The jar file may also be used 
in the command line. Use the command `java -jar path/to/jar -d` in order to open a REPL. This will allow you to pass a path to the program to generate a schema diagram.

Please email `Shimizu.5@wright.edu` in order to report a bug or use the issues in GitHub.

### [**MODL: A Modular Ontology Design Library**](https://github.com/cogan-shimizu-wsu/modular-ontology-design-library)
Pattern-based, modular ontologies have several beneficial properties that lend themselves to FAIR data practices, 
especially as it pertains to Interoperability and Reusability. However, developing such ontologies has a high upfront cost, 
e.g. reusing a pattern is predicated upon being aware of its existence in the first place. Thus, to help overcome these 
barriers, we have developed MODL: a modular ontology design library. MODL is a curated collection of well-documented ontology 
design patterns, drawn from a wide variety of interdisciplinary use-cases.

This page serves as a dereferenceable URL for the MODL namespace. We also take advantage of this space to distribute 
Version 1.0.0 of MODL as a ZIP archive. It contains all the patterns, documentation, and the MODL OPLa ontology.
