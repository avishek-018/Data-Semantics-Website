# Modular Ontology Engineering

Modular Ontology Engineering is an opinionated approach to ontology engineering,
by which it is informed by pattern-based methods. In many cases, ontologies are 
designed to be schemas for knowledge graphs; there is a [separate page](/research/knowledge-graphs) 
documenting our contributions to knowledge graphs foundations and applications.
