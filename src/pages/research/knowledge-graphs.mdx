# Knowledge Graphs

We contribute to foundations and applications of knowledge graphs. Touching their complete life cycle. This includes schema design (which is detailed on a [separate page](/research/modular-ontology-engineering)), general principles and processes for graph design, deployment of large-scale graphs in application areas including the geo-sciences, digital humanities, and agricultural themes, as well as methods and applications for graph integration and schema alignment.
