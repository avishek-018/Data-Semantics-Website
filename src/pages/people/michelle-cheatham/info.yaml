  description: Hello! I'm Michelle Cheatham. I've had something of a winding career
    path -- after spending a decade working for various companies and government organizations,
    I decided to pursue a PhD. I graduated in the summer of 2014 and joined the faculty
    at Wright State just a month later. My research interests are in semantic data
    integration, automated population and structuring of knowledge bases, and privacy
    concerns related to Big Data.
