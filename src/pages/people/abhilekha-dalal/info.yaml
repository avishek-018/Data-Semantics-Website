    my dissertation research project that revolves around the fascinating realm of
    Explainable AI. My research project focuses on explaining the activation pattern
    of hidden neurons of neural networks in a human-interpretable manner by using
    knowledge graphs as background knowledge for images. arXiv paper at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03999.'
