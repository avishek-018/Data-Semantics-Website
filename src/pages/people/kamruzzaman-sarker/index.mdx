## Bio:

Welcome! Please visit my homepage: https://mdkzaman.com

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the Department of Computing Sciences at the University of Hartford. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (CAIDS) at Kansas State University from January 2021 to August 2021. I completed my PhD in 2020 and worked at DaSe Lab from 2016 to 2020 with Dr. Pascal Hitzler. I gained industry experience through internships at Intel and Accenture, where I analyzed TensorFlow performance on Intel CPUs and studied explainable AI methods. Before my PhD, I worked at Samsung Electronics as a software engineer on the connectivity module of Android OS. I have an MS in Computer Science and a Big and Smart Data Graduate certificate from Wright State University, and I completed the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.
