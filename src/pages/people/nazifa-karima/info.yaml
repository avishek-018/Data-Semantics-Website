  description: I am a graduate student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering
    at the Wright State University. I work under the supervision of Dr. Pascal Hitzler
    in the Data Semantics Lab. I am currently involved with the Geolink project which
    is one of the may building blocks of the NSF-funded Earthcube program. The main
    aim of this project is to implement semantic web technologies to ensure improved
    data discovery, sharing integration and representation.
