about: '# About

The Data Semantics Lab at Kansas State University is dedicated to 
advancing research at the intersection of artificial intelligence, 
knowledge representation, and data science. Our work focuses on neuro-symbolic 
AI and semantic ontology graphs, aiming to enhance reasoning, learning, and 
explainability in these systems. Traditional machine learning models excel at 
pattern recognition but often struggle with logical inference, common-sense 
reasoning, and generalization. To address these limitations, we study methods that integrate symbolic 
reasoning with neural network-based learning, combining the strengths of knowledge 
graphs, symbolic reasoning, and deep learning. This hybrid approach enables intelligent systems that 
are more interpretable, capable of logical reasoning, and effective in data-sparse domains.


A key component of our research involves semantic ontology graphs, which provide a structured, 
logic-based representation of knowledge. These graphs enable machines to understand contextual 
relationships, perform semantic reasoning, and integrate heterogeneous data sources. Our work 
spans ontology engineering, automated ontology learning, and semantic data integration, ensuring 
that AI systems can leverage structured knowledge for improved decision-making. By developing and 
refining ontologies, it enhances a system's ability to align and unify diverse datasets, enabling more 
robust and context-aware applications.'
