    \ Phase I project will be to help connect the vast community of geographic information\
    \ systems users in industry, government agencies, academia, and the broader public,\
    \ to knowledge graphs. Knowledge graphs consist of interlinked pieces of information\
    \ about our world. By connecting data across different domains, multimedia formats,\
    \ and perspectives, knowledge graphs enable users to ask more complicated questions\
    \ and arrive at a more holistic understanding of complex physical and social processes.\
    \ This project focuses on the tools needed to identify and link space and time\
    \ for knowledge graphs. These tools are important because everything happens somewhere\
    \ and at some time and because knowing where and when things happen is critical\
    \ to understanding why and how they happen. Currently geographic information systems\
    \ in use in academia, industry, and governments are not yet well integrated with\
    \ knowledge graphs. This project's highly interdisciplinary team (representing\

    \ For instance, there is no agreed upon method to spatio-temporally restrict statements\
    \ such as changing national boundaries. Similarly, established machine-learning\
    \ techniques used to infer new knowledge graph statements or to summarize existing\

    \ is to reach convergence on how to efficiently represent, retrieve, and analyze\
    \ the spatial and temporal aspects present in almost all datasets irrespective\
    \ of the individual disciplines they originate from, resulting in interoperability\

    The National Science Foundation''s EarthCube program has set out to establish
    concepts and approaches to create integrated data infrastructures across the Geosciences.
    On of its key challenges is to enable and simplify data publishing, discovery,
    access, reuse, and integration in a sustainable way. Existing data repositories
    and networks must be linked, while retaining their independent missions and services
    to existing disciplinary communities. Cultural, conceptual, and infrastructural
    heterogeneities must be respected in order to maintain different perspectives,
    topics, granularities, and differing priorities and thus foster inclusivity in
    the EarthCube endeavor. In particular, individual choices made by providers of
    data or repositories will need to be respected in an inclusive manner, and approaches
    to integration must reflect this. At the same time, however, the diversity and
    heterogeneity of geoscience data presents a significant barrier to its discovery
    and reuse.

    The NSF EarthCube Building Block project GeoLink addresses these challenges by
    1) digital publication of geoscience data and knowledge as "Linked Open Data";
    combined with 2) semantic integration by way of describing data using ontology
    design patterns and vocabularies shared among federated repositories; and 3) establishing
    Linked Data and ontology design patterns as an underlying cyberinfrastructure
    extendable in both depth and breadth, that can become a central building block
    for EarthCube data harmonization.

    GeoLink focuses on the use of smart data as an alternative to smart applications,
    and will effectively begin to establish an ontology-based metadata ecostystem
    which consists of flexibly alignable ontology building blocks.

    GeoLink will greatly enhance the capabilities for scientists to discover and interpret
    relevant geoscience data and knowledge. It will lower barriers to cross-repository
    data discovery and access, while respecting and preserving repository autonomy
    and heterogeneity. The cyberinfrastructure underlying the approach is extendable,
    sustainable, and affordable - leveraging state of the art developments in Linked
    Open Data and formal semantics, grounded through shared ontology design patterns.
    The value of the approach will finally be showcased by developing a Web portal
    that enables searching and browsing of integrated content from multiple repositories,
    serving a diverse collection of geoscience communities. munities. The project
    was showcased in the January 2015 edition of Science magazine.

    Drs Michelle Cheatham and Pascal Hitzler, directors of the Data Semantics (DaSe)
    Lab at Wright State University, are part of the consortium of collaborators funded
    with approx. $1.9M by the National Science Foundation through the EarthCube program.

    Pascal Hitzler Co-PI

    Linked Open Data (LOD) is rapidly developing into an open data movement to connect
    a large variety of data across the World Wide Web using standards adopted by the
    World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Driven by researchers, government agencies and
    companies, the resulting Web of Data has grown to over 1000 datasets and is showing
    exponential growth. However, simply putting collections of data on the Web will
    be of very limited value. The key to unlocking the value for developing more powerful
    search, browsing, exploration and analysis is to richly interlink or semantically
    integrate components of LOD. Given the size, growth rate, heterogeneity and growing
    areas of coverage, manual semantic integration or interlinking is not practical.
    Furthermore, current techniques focus on a construct owl:sameAs that is abused
    due to limited expressiveness, and hence is ineffective or yields poor quality
    of integration. What is needed is to be able to represent and identify richer
    and more explicit relationships between different entities, so that the richness
    of the real world is not crammed inaccurately and inappropriately into very limited
    types of relationships. At the same time, exponential growth of the LOD in terms
    of size and diversity creates challenges to identify and analyze datasets for
    both human and application consumptions. Even though popular datasets such as
    DBPedia, Freebase, MusicBrainz are well known and widely used in the community,
    there can be other hidden gems that will be useful for specialized applications.

    To address the challenges, this project developed exploratory techniques to richly
    interlink components of LOD, address the challenges of querying the LOD cloud
    and propose approaches to discover datasets compress and create entity summaries.'

flipping-the-classroom-combining-scale-up-and-distance-learning:
  description: 'Wright State University Teaching Innovation Award

    The Department of Computer Science and Engineering is successfully pursuing multiple
    efforts to modernize the modes of delivery of its classes. In particular, this
    includes active learning using SCALE-UP classrooms, and distance learning sections
    for traditional classes. In this project, we leverage existing infrastructure
    to create a class setting where a single teacher can provide, within a single
    class section, both an active learning experience and a distance learning setting,
    depending on student needs.

    In this project we develop and realize a way to improve the mode of delivery of
    classes with theoretical content by switching to a flipped classroom active learning
    experience for the physically attending students, while at the same time catering
    for students which cannot physically attend the class. The new setting has two
    main benefits. First, it improves the learning experience by physically attending
    students. Secondly, it also provides a cost-efficient way to offer a distance
    learning option for the same class, without the need to establish a separately
    taught online section.

knowwheregraph-enriching-and-linking-cross-domain:
  description: 'Consortium-hosted project website: http://www.knowwheregraph.org

    The goal of this project is to improve data-driven decision making and data analytics,
    specifically data analytics that involve geographic data. This project will create
    the KnowWhereGraph - a knowledge graph tool that specifically enables other data-analysis
    knowledge tools that have a geospatial component.

    GeoEnrichment describes the process by which data becomes augmented with a wide
    range of auxiliary information tailored to a geospatial study area (such as demographic
    data). GeoEnrichment tools significantly reduce the costs involved in acquiring,
    entering, and cleaning geo-data. Unfortunately, currently available geoenrichment
    services provide access to only pre-defined categories of information, do not
    effectively handle interconnected data, offer limited support for data integration,
    and are generally expensive. This project plans to make data-driven decision making
    and data analytics substantially more effective, accessible, and affordable. The
    project will merge novel Artificial Intelligence-based geoenrichment technologies
    with a knowledge graph that brings together open, cross-domain, densely integrated
    data spanning the human-environment interface.

    This project''s work is enabled by an open, freely usable knowledge graph. These
    graphs are a combination of scalable, Web-standard technologies, specifications,
    and data cultures for representing densely interconnected statements derived from
    structured or unstructured data across domains, in both human and machine-readable
    ways. The technology tools are designed to be useful to and useable by researchers,
    analysts, decision-makers, and the interested public in any domain or cross-domain
    activity requiring geospatial intelligence.

    This project includes strong partnerships with non-academic and academic stakeholders
    including 4 for-profit organizations, 2 government agencies, and one non-profit,
    as well as five academic partnerships: ESRI (Geographic Information Systems);
    Oliver Wyman, (commodity markets and supply chains), Princeton Climate Analytics
    (weather and climate information services), In10T (digital agriculture, farm partnerships);
    US Geological Survey (USGS), Natural Resources Conservation Service within the
    U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA): and DirectRelief (humanitarian aid); as
    well as University of California Santa Barbara(UCSB), Kansas State University
    (K-State), Michigan State University (MSU), Arizona State University (ASU), and
    University of Southern California(USC). Additional partnerships are expected to
    develop during this Phase II effort.

    The KnowWhereGraph will be a valuable element of the Convergence Accelerator Phase
    II cohort, providing geospatial tools to the other projects within the cohort.
    In addition the project plans to focus on several strategic application areas
    that are likely to benefit US society, including: COVID-19 related supply chain
    disruptions and the US food, agriculture, and energy sectors, and their attendant
    supply chains generally; environmental policy issues relative to interactions
    among agricultural sustainability, soil conservation practice, and farm labor;
    and delivery of emergency humanitarian aid, within the US and internationally.
    Anytime knowing where is key, this project''s tools may be helpful.

    Formally, a knowledge graph consists of a massive set of statements, constructed
    from inter-connected node- and edge-labeled resources, allowing multiple, heterogeneous
    edges for the same nodes. A collection of definitional statements specifying the
    meaning of the knowledge graph''s vocabulary is called its (KG) schema or ontology.
    The ontology is critical for rigorous logical interpretation and machine-actionability.
    Several innovations in knowledge graph technology will drive the project: (I)
    creating an open, web-accessible knowledge graph, with attendant methods and tools,
    to enable contributions to the graph from a range of sources; (II) developing
    strategies for semantically lifting imagery data, such as remotely sensed imagery
    and drone imagery, into this graph, thereby integrating vast amounts of data;
    (III) developing novel spatially-explicit AI-based methods, models, and services
    to enable geoenrichment on top of this graph; and (IV) developing both programmatic
    (application program interface, API) and human-accessible interfaces for the KnowWhereGraph.
    By merging the flexibility, expressive power, and community-driven features of
    open graph technologies with multi-format geospatial data and advanced geospatial
    intelligence, the KnowWhereGraph is designed to become a rich, integrative information
    resource that can transform and converge discovery, analysis, and synthesis within
    and across a multitude of fields and sectors.

open-science-data-in-semantic-web:
  description: 'Establishing Open Science as the default practice in the academic
    community is critical. Reporting a research result is more than just the manuscript.
    It is the actual process undertaken, the data (and metadata), the implemented
    software (and environment), and more. It is also important to ask questions pertaining
    to transparency and reproducibility, such as those regarding their reviews, publishing
    metadata, and, in particular, Where are the data and software that underlie their
    reported results? By making the connections between these artifacts through Open
    Science practices, it democratizes research by lowering the barrier of entry to
    understanding (and replicating) cutting edge research, while simultaneously accelerating
    novel research by reducing the need to re-implement software or re-collect data.
    Connecting these components and data in a useful and understandable way is a core
    mission of Semantic Web research.

    In this project we leverage the leadership and reputation of the Semantic Web
    journal by IOS Press to demonstrate that the open sharing of data underlying publications
    can be done without significant overhead and provides significant added value.
    We will, for this journal, require authors to sustainably publish the data and
    software underlying their results, include software and data provision as part
    of the peer review assessment, and publish rich metadata for the supplementary
    data and software. We will develop technology in support of open science and will
    work with the community to refine the software and policies that enhance open
    science for the Semantic Web journal. The approach can serve as a model for other
    journal editors who seek a blueprint for adopting similar Open Science Data practices.

    This project is a collaboration with STKO lab, University of California, Santa
    Barbara (Krzysztof Janowicz), and IOS Press, Amsterdam.

  description: 'Semantic Web is an inherently multi-disciplinary field. Yet, the division
    between computer science, natural science and social science limits the formation
    of a coherent national agenda for exploring emerging trends in Semantic Technologies.
    There is an urgent need to bring together the U.S. Semantic Web community and
    begin forming such a research network among Semantic Web practitioners in different
    domains. The increasing demand of data-intensive research and the multidisciplinary
    characteristics of Semantic Web applications make it crucial to maintain and expand
    the existing workforce through outreach to students to foster future scientific
    innovation across disciplines. The objective of this project is to provide travel
    supports to ten U.S. student participants to the 1st U.S. Semantic Technologies
    Symposium (US2TS), which will be held at Dayton, Ohio during March 01-02, 2018.
    Broader impacts of the project include: Provide opportunities for under-represented
    groups (women and minorities) and undergraduates in networking, and vision and
    capacitate building, foster long-lasting interdisciplinary and national-wide collaborations
    among a new generation of Semantic Web practitioners who will ultimately shape
    the future of Semantic Web research and application at all levels.

    Cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral communication and networking among Semantic
    Web practitioners is the core of US2TS. With an ever-growing dependence on the
    web, and the continuously increasing importance of large-scale data sharing, integration,
    and reuse, researchers in various disciplines have taken an increasing interest
    in the Semantic Web. To connect among the silo efforts, what are needed are community
    consolidation and the building of a U.S.-based community research network. The
    symposium will provide a forum by which participants can share information and
    ideas, coordinate ongoing or planned research activities, foster synthesis and
    new collaborations, develop community standards, and advance their science and
    education through communication and the sharing of ideas. Several activities will
    be organized for the student participants during the symposium. Through the student
    supports of this project, a big potential of US2TS outputs is the improved understanding
    and skills of open data and open science among the next generation scientists,
    as Semantic Web technologies are closely relevant to those topics.

    and Xiaomao Lin (Agronomy).

    Changing climate, environmental, socio-political, and economic forces are increasingly
    straining the global food system’s ability to meet the food and fiber requirements
    of a growing human population. Despite rapid technological advances, the myriad
    of interdependencies in this complex system continues to hinder efforts to develop
    and implement solutions to challenges to food system sustainability in more than
    a piecemeal fashion. Recent growth in the development of Knowledge Graphs (KGs)
    as a method of data and knowledge management as well as using KGs to transform
    large-scale, diverse and complex data and knowledge into analysis offers a means
    of more systematically and efficiently addressing the complex interdependencies
    inherent in the global food system. In this project, we develop - with the guidance
    of stakeholders - a KG focused on sustainable intensification of wheat production
    as a first step in building a Global Food Systems Data Hub, concomitantly with
    seeding a Center for Sustainable Wheat Production. An expert elicitation workshop
    with the goal of defining sustainable wheat systems by major stakeholders across
    the entire wheat supply chain will kick off the project. Findings from this workshop
    will later guide the development of a wheat sustainability KG. Simultaneously,
    the utility of this KG will be illustrated through three wheat-related use cases
    relevant to the agricultural sector in Kansas and development of a public-facing
    Data Hub. These efforts will pave the way for Kansas State as the leader in sustainable
    agriculture data management, production, and application while simultaneously
    supporting a major economic sector for Kansas by enabling decision support for
    food security applications, development of policy and management solutions relevant
    to local stakeholders.

    This is a collaborative effort with the Air Force Research Laboratory (PIs Christopher
    Myers, Adam Stevens, Benji Maruyama) and Drexel University (PI Dario Salvucci).

    Autonomous systems are a new frontier for pushing sociotechnical advancement.
    Such systems will eventually become pervasive, involved in everything from manufacturing,
    healthcare, defense, and even research itself. However, proliferation is stifled
    by the high development costs and the resulting inflexibility of the produced
    systems. The current time needed to create and integrate state of the art autonomous
    systems that operate as team members in complex situations is a 3-15 year development
    period, often requiring humans to adapt to limitations in the resulting systems.
    A new research thrust in interactive task learning has begun, calling for natural
    human-autonomy interaction to facilitate system flexibility and minimize users’
    complexity in providing autonomous systems with new tasks. In this project, we
    respond to Laird, et al.’s (2017) call through the development of a cognitive
    system capable of independently acquiring most required task knowledge and skill
    to perform a set of tasks.

    Our proposed approach begins with the development of a foundational and generalizable
    cognitive system that can be transformed into a specialized cognitive agent through
    written instruction, interactions with its trainers, task experience, and developer
    intervention (when needed). Specifically, we seek to research and develop an undifferentiated
    agent (uAgent) that is a set of general-purpose computational cognitive capacities
    enabling it to read task instructions, iteratively interact with trainers to fill
    gaps in task knowledge, generate the requisite task knowledge from the instructions,
    and complete multitasking scenarios of varying complexity. We propose to further
    specialize the agent to desired levels of task proficiency using the Autonomous
    Research System (ARES).

tron-tractable-reasoning-with-ontologies:
  description: 'The Semantic Web is based on describing the meaning - or semantics
    - of data on the Web by means of metadata - data describing other data - in the
    form of ontologies. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has made several recommended
    standards for ontology languages which differ in expressivity and ease of use.
    Central to these languages is that they come with a formal semantics, expressed
    in model-theoretic terms, which enables access to implicit knowledge by automated
    reasoning. Progress in the adoption of reasoning for ontology languages in practice
    is currently being made, but several obstacles remain to be overcome for wide
    adoption on the Web. In this project, we investigate the use of tractable and
    other ontology languages from several perspectives, with a focus on extending
    description logics based ontology languages around OWL with further capabilities,
    while staying tractable if possible. Some of the aspects considered include the
    integration of rules languages with OWL, paraconsistent and non-monotonic reasoning,
    ontology modeling advances in particular related to geoscience applications, and
    reasoning algorithms and tools.
